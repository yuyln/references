  abstract  = {We numerically examine the dynamics of a single skyrmion driven over triangular and honeycomb obstacle arrays at zero temperature. The skyrmion Hall angle θ sk, defined as the angle between the applied external drive and the direction of the skyrmion motion, increases in quantized steps or continuously as a function of the applied drive. For the obstacle arrays studied in this work, the skyrmion exhibits two main directional locking angles of θ sk = −30° and −60°. We show that these directions are privileged due to the obstacle landscape symmetry, and coincide with channels along which the skyrmion may move with few or no obstacle collisions. Here we investigate how changes in the obstacle density can modify the skyrmion Hall angles and cause some dynamic phases to appear or grow while other phases vanish. This interesting behavior can be used to guide skyrmions along designated trajectories via regions with different obstacle densities. For fixed obstacle densities, we investigate the evolution of the locked θ sk = −30° and −60° phases as a function of the Magnus force, and discuss possibilities for switching between these phases using topological selection.},

  abstract  = {Using a particle-based model, we simulate the behavior of a skyrmion under the influence of asymmetric funnel geometries and ac driving at zero temperature. We specifically investigate possibilities for controlling the skyrmion motion by harnessing a ratchet effect. Our results show that as the amplitude of a unidirectional ac drive is increased, the skyrmion can be set into motion along either the easy or hard direction of the funnel depending on the ac driving direction. When the ac drive is parallel to the funnel axis, the skyrmion flows in the easy direction and its average velocity is quantized. In contrast, when the ac drive is perpendicular to the funnel axis, a Magnus-induced ratchet effect occurs, and the skyrmion moves along the hard direction with a constant average velocity. For biharmonic ac driving of equal amplitude along both the parallel and perpendicular directions, we observe a reentrant pinning phase where the skyrmion ratchet vanishes. For asymmetric biharmonic ac drives, the skyrmion exhibits a combination of effects and can move in either the easy or hard direction depending on the configuration of the ac drives. These results indicate that it is possible to achieve controlled skyrmion motion using funnel geometries, and we discuss ways in which this could be harnessed to perform data transfer operations.},

  abstract   = {Using a particle-based model we examine the depinning motion of solitons in skyrmion chains in quasi-one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) systems containing embedded 1D interfaces. The solitons take the form of a particle or hole in a commensurate chain of skyrmions. Under an applied drive, just above a critical depinning threshold, the soliton moves with a skyrmion Hall angle of zero. For higher drives, the entire chain depins, and in a 2D system we observe that both the solitons and chain move at zero skyrmion Hall angle and then transition to a finite skyrmion Hall angle as the drive increases. In a 2D system with a 1D interface that is at an angle to the driving direction, there can be a reversal of the sign of the skyrmion Hall angle from positive to negative. Our results suggest that solitons in skyrmion systems could be used as information carriers in racetrack geometries that would avoid the drawbacks of finite skyrmion Hall angles. The soliton states become mobile at significantly lower drives than the depinning transition of the skyrmion chains themselves.},

  abstract  = {Using a particle-based model, we examine the collective dynamics of skyrmions interacting with a funnel potential under dc driving as the skyrmion density and relative strength of the Magnus and damping terms are varied. For driving in the easy direction, we find that increasing the skyrmion density reduces the average skyrmion velocity due to jamming of skyrmions near the funnel opening, while the Magnus force causes skyrmions to accumulate on one side of the funnel array. For driving in the hard direction, there is a critical skyrmion density below which the skyrmions become trapped. Above this critical value, a clogging effect appears with multiple depinning and repinning states where the skyrmions can rearrange into different clogged configurations, while at higher drives, the velocity-force curves become continuous. When skyrmions pile up near the funnel opening, the effective size of the opening is reduced and the passage of other skyrmions is blocked by the repulsive skyrmion–skyrmion interactions. We observe a strong diode effect in which the critical depinning force is higher and the velocity response is smaller for hard direction driving. As the ratio of Magnus force to dissipative term is varied, the skyrmion velocity varies in a non-linear and non-monotonic way due to the pile up of skyrmions on one side of the funnels. At high Magnus forces, the clogging effect for hard direction driving is diminished.},

  abstract  = {Using a particle based model, we investigate the skyrmion dynamical behavior in a channel where the upper wall contains divots of one depth and the lower wall contains divots of a different depth. Under an applied driving force, skyrmions in the channels move with a finite skyrmion Hall angle that deflects them toward the upper wall for −x direction driving and the lower wall for +x direction driving. When the upper divots have zero height, the skyrmions are deflected against the flat upper wall for −x direction driving and the skyrmion velocity depends linearly on the drive. For +x direction driving, the skyrmions are pushed against the lower divots and become trapped, giving reduced velocities and a nonlinear velocity-force response. When there are shallow divots on the upper wall and deep divots on the lower wall, skyrmions get trapped for both driving directions; however, due to the divot depth difference, skyrmions move more easily under −x direction driving, and become strongly trapped for +x direction driving. The preferred −x direction motion produces what we call a Magnus diode effect since it vanishes in the limit of zero Magnus force, unlike the diode effects observed for asymmetric sawtooth potentials. We show that the transport curves can exhibit a series of jumps or dips, negative differential conductivity, and reentrant pinning due to collective trapping events. We also discuss how our results relate to recent continuum modeling on a similar skyrmion diode system.},

  abstract  = {We use atomistic-based simulations to investigate the behavior of ferromagnetic skyrmions being continuously compressed against a rigid wall under dc and ac drives. The compressed skyrmions can be annihilated close to the wall and form a conformal crystal with both a size and a density gradient, making it distinct from conformal crystals observed previously for superconducting vortices and colloidal particles. For both dc and ac driving, the skyrmions can move transverse to the compression direction due to a combination of density and size gradients. Forces in the compression direction are converted by the Magnus force into transverse motion. Under ac driving, the amount of skyrmion annihilation is reduced and we find a skyrmion Magnus ratchet pump. We also observe shear banding in which skyrmions near the wall move up to twice as fast as skyrmions further from the wall. When we vary the magnitude of the applied drive, we find a critical current above which the skyrmions are completely annihilated during a time scale that depends on the magnitude of the drive. By varying the magnetic parameters, we find that the transverse motion is strongly dependent on the skyrmion size. Smaller skyrmions are more rigid, which interferes with the size gradient and destroys the transverse motion. We also confirm the role of the size gradient by comparing our atomistic simulations with a particle-based model, where we find that the transverse motion is only transient. Our results are relevant for applications where skyrmions encounter repulsive magnetic walls, domain walls, or interfaces.},

  abstract = {Using atomistic magnetic simulations we investigate the soliton motion along a pinned skyrmion chain containing an interstitial skyrmion. We find that the soliton can exhibit stable motion along the chain without a skyrmion Hall effect for an extended range of drives. Under a constant drive the solitons have a constant velocity. We also measure the skyrmion velocity–current curves and identify the signatures of different phases including a pinned phase, stable soliton motion, and quasi-free motion at higher drives where all of the skyrmions depin from the pinning centers and move along the rigid wall. In the quasi-free motion regime, the velocity is oscillatory due to the motion of the skyrmions over the pinning sites. For increasing pinning strength, the onset of soliton motion shifts to higher values of current density. We also find that for stronger pinning, the characteristic velocity–current shape is affected by the annihilation of single or multiple skyrmions in the drive interval over which the soliton motion occurs. Our results indicate that stable skyrmion soliton motion is possible and that the solitons could be used as information carriers instead of the skyrmions themselves for technological applications.},

  abstract  = {Using atomistic simulations, we have investigated the transport and annihilation of skyrmions interacting with a funnel array under a current applied perpendicular to the funnel axis. We find that transport without annihilation is possible at low currents, when the motion is dominated by skyrmion–skyrmion interactions and skyrmions push each other through the funnel opening. Skyrmion annihilation occurs for higher currents when skyrmions in the upper half of the sample exert pressure on skyrmions in the bottom half of the sample due to the external current. Upon interacting with the funnel wall, the skyrmions undergo a size reduction that makes it easier for them to pass through the funnel opening. We find five phases as a function of the applied current and the size of the funnel opening: (i) pinned, (ii) transport without annihilation, (iii) transport with annihilation, (iv) complete annihilation, and (v) a reentrant pinning phase that only occurs for very narrow openings. Our findings provide insight into how to control skyrmion transport using funnel arrays by delineating regimes in which transport of skyrmions is possible as well as the conditions under which annihilation occurs.},

  abstract  = {Using atomistic simulations, we investigate the dynamical behavior of a single skyrmion interacting with an asymmetric linear protrusion array under external ac driving. The linear protrusion array is placed in the 𝑥⁢𝑦 plane and is composed of magnetic walls near the edge of the nanotrack that have angled linear protrusions into the nanotrack. The structure forms a hard axis for −𝑥 direction motion and an easy axis for +𝑥 direction motion. When the ac drive is applied along the 𝑥 direction, the skyrmion moves along the hard direction of the substrate asymmetry in three phases: a pinned phase with localized skyrmion orbits, a constant velocity phase where the orbits become delocalized, and a reentrant pinned phase with larger localized orbits. We measure the dependence of the skyrmion velocity on the frequency and amplitude of the ac drive. All three phases appear for all frequency values simulated here, and in the constant velocity phase the skyrmion velocity depends only on the frequency and not on the amplitude of the ac drive. When ac driving is applied in the 𝑦 direction, the skyrmion moves along the easy direction of the substrate asymmetry and exhibits the same three phases as for 𝑥-direction driving along with a fourth phase which, at high driving frequencies, consists of a series of constant velocity phases, each with different average skyrmion velocities. For low frequencies, the constant velocity phase is lost and the skyrmion speed increases linearly with increasing ac drive amplitude due to a Magnus boost effect. Our findings suggest new ways to create reliable data transport for spintronic devices using skyrmions as information carriers, where the skyrmion direction and speed can be controlled by varying only the ac drive amplitude and frequency.},

The skyrmion changes in size as it crosses the interface between two anisotropy regions. On applying combined dc and ac driving in either parallel or perpendicular directions, we observe a wide variety of Shapiro steps, Shapiro spikes, and phase-locking phenomena. The phase-locked orbits have two-dimensional dynamics due to the gyrotropic or Magnus dynamics of the skyrmions and are distinct from the phase-locked orbits found for strictly overdamped systems. Along a given Shapiro step when the ac drive is perpendicular to the dc drive, the velocity parallel to the ac drive is locked while the velocity in the perpendicular direction increases with increasing drive to form Shapiro spikes. At the transition between adjacent Shapiro steps, the parallel velocity jumps up to the next step value, and the perpendicular velocity drops. The skyrmion Hall angle shows a series of spikes as a function of increasing dc drive, where the jumps correspond to the transition between different phase-locked steps. At high drives, the Shapiro steps and Shapiro spikes are lost. When both the ac and dc drives are parallel to the stripe periodicity direction, Shapiro steps appear, while if the dc drive is parallel to the stripe periodicity direction and the ac drive is perpendicular to the stripe periodicity, then there are only two locked phases, and the skyrmion motion consists of a combination of sliding along the interfaces between the two anisotropy values and jumping across the interfaces.},

For low ac amplitudes, at all fillings reversible motion appears in which the skyrmions return to their original positions at the end of each ac drive cycle and the diffusion is zero. We also identify two distinct irreversible regimes. The first is a translating regime in which the skyrmions form channels of flow in opposing directions and translate by one substrate lattice constant per ac drive cycle. The translating state appears in the dimer and trimer arrangements, and produces pronounced peaks in the diffusivity in the direction perpendicular to the external drive. For larger ac amplitudes, we find chaotic irreversible motion in which the skyrmions can randomly exchange places with each other over time, producing long-time diffusive behavior both parallel and perpendicular to the ac driving direction.},

  abstract  = {We compare the dynamical behavior of magnetic skyrmions interacting with square and triangular defect arrays just above commensuration using both atomistic and particle-based models. Under applied drives, the initial motion is a kink traveling through the pinned skyrmion lattice. For the square defect array, both models agree well and show a regime in which the soliton motion is locked along 45°. The atomistic model also produces locking of a soliton along 30°, which is absent in the particle-based model. For the triangular defect array, the atomistic model exhibits 30° soliton motion over a wide region of external current values. In contrast, the particle-based model gives 45° soliton motion over a small range of external driving force values. The difference arises because the nondeforming particle model facilitates meandering skyrmion orbits while the deformable atomistic model enables stronger skyrmion-skyrmion interactions that reduce the meandering. Our results indicate that soliton motion through pinned skyrmion lattices on a periodic substrate is a robust effect.},

  abstract     = {Many driven binary systems can exhibit laning transitions when the two species have different mobilities, such as colloidal particles with opposite charges in electric fields. Another example is pedestrian or active matter systems, where particles moving in opposite directions form a phase-separated state that enhances the overall mobility. In this work, we use atomistic simulations to demonstrate that mixtures of skyrmions and skyrmioniums also exhibit pattern formation and laning transitions. Skyrmions move more slowly and at a finite Hall angle compared to skyrmioniums, which move faster and without a Hall effect. At low drives, the system forms a partially jammed phase where the skyrmionium is dragged by the surrounding skyrmions, resulting in a finite angle of motion for the skyrmionium. At higher drives, the system transitions into a laned state, but unlike colloidal systems, the lanes in the skyrmion skyrmionium mixture are tilted relative to the driving direction due to the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. In the laned state, the skyrmionium angle of motion is reversed when it aligns with the tilted lane structure. At even higher drives, the skyrmioniums collapse into skyrmions. Below a critical skyrmion density, both textures can move independently with few collisions, but above this density, the laning state disappears entirely, and the system transitions to a skyrmion-only state. We map out the velocity and Hall responses of the different textures and identify three distinct phases: partially jammed, laned, and skyrmion-only moving crystal states. We compare our results to recent observations of tilted laning phases in pedestrian flows, where chiral symmetry breaking in the particle interactions leads to similar behavior.},

  abstract     = {Using atomistic simulations, we examine the dynamics of three-dimensional magnetic hopfions interacting with an array of line defects or posts as a function of defect spacing, defect strength, and current. We find a pinned phase, a sliding phase where a hopfion can move through the posts or hurdles by distorting, and a regime where the hopfion becomes compressed and transforms into a toron that is half the size of the hopfion and moves at a lower velocity. The toron states occur when the defects are strong; however, in the toron regime, it is possible to stabilize sliding hopfions by increasing the applied current. Hopfions move without a Hall angle, while the toron moves with a finite Hall angle. We also show that when a hopfion interacts with an asymmetric array of planar defects, a ratchet effect consisting of a net dc motion can be realized under purely ac driving.},

  year         = {2025},
  abstract     = {We examine a skyrmionium driven over a periodic anisotropy pattern, which consists of disorder free regions and disordered regions. For small defect densities, the skyrmionium flows for an extended range of currents, and there is a critical current above which it transforms into a skyrmion. For increased amounts of quenched disorder, the current needed for the skyrmionium to transform into a skyrmion decreases, and there is a critical disorder density above which a moving skyrmionium is not stable. In the moving state, the skyrmionium to skyrmion transformation leads to a drop in the velocity and the onset of a finite skyrmion Hall angle. We also find a reentrance effect in which the pinned skyrmionium transforms into a skyrmion just above depinning, restabilizes into skyrmionium at larger drives, and becomes unstable again at large currents. We also show that adding a transverse shaking drive can increase the lifetime of a moving skyrmionium by reducing the effect of the pinning in the direction of the drive.},

  year         = {2024},
  abstract     = {We compare the driven dynamics of skyrmions, antiskyrmions, and skyrmionium interacting with random disorder, circular defects, and asymmetric potentials. When interacting with a line defect at a constant drive, skyrmions and antiskyrmions show an acceleration effect for motion along the wall and a drop in velocity when they can cross the barrier. In contrast, skyrmionium travels at a reduced velocity when moving along a wall, and exhibits an increase in velocity once it can cross the barrier. For point defects, skyrmionium can be pinned for a finite fixed period of time, while for skyrmions and antiskyrmions, the Magnus force creates a deflection from the defect and an acceleration effect. For a given drive, skyrmionium moves twice as fast as skyrmions; however, skyrmionium is more susceptible to pinning effects than skyrmions and antiskyrmions. Additionally, there is a critical threshold where the skyrmionium transforms to a skyrmion that is associated with a drop in the velocity of the texture. We show that all three textures exhibit diode and ratchet effects when interacting with an asymmetric substrate, but skyrmions and antiskyrmions show a stronger ratcheting effect than skyrmionium due to the Magnus force.},
